# MicroPython Requirements for Pico Web Server
# These modules are built into MicroPython for Raspberry Pi Pico

# Core modules (built-in)
network          # WiFi functionality
socket           # Network communication
machine          # Hardware access (Pin, ADC)
time             # Time delays
gc               # Garbage collection

# Hardware requirements
# - Raspberry Pi Pico W (for WiFi capability)
# - Built-in LED on GP25
# - ADC input on GP26 (optional analog sensor)

# Optional hardware for testing
# - Potentiometer or analog sensor connected to GP26
# - Breadboard and jumper wires for external connections
